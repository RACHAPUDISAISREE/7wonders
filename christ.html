        <p>Christ the Redeemer is an iconic statue that overlooks the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from the summit of Mount Corcovado. Standing at an impressive height of 30 meters (98 feet), the statue is a symbol of Brazilian Christianity and is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. Created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and constructed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, the statue was completed in 1931.

            Christ the Redeemer depicts Jesus Christ with outstretched arms, symbolizing peace and blessing. The statue is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone, and its design incorporates elements of the Art Deco style. It has become a symbol of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to marvel at its breathtaking panoramic views of the city and the surrounding landscape.
            
            In 2007, Christ the Redeemer was designated as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, further solidifying its status as a global cultural and religious icon. The statue's imposing presence, combined with its rich symbolism and cultural significance, makes it a remarkable testament to both artistry and faith.</p>
