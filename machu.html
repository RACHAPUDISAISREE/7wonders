        <p>Machu Picchu, often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas," is a breathtaking archaeological marvel nestled high in the Andes Mountains of Peru. Built in the 15th century by the Inca emperor Pachacuti, this ancient citadel is renowned for its stunning location and sophisticated construction. Perched at an elevation of approximately 2,430 meters (7,970 feet) above sea level, Machu Picchu offers panoramic views of the surrounding lush green mountains and the Urubamba River below.

            The site comprises well-preserved stone structures, including temples, plazas, and residential areas, showcasing the advanced engineering skills of the Inca civilization. The precise layout of the city and its impressive terracing system highlight the ingenuity of the Inca people in adapting to the challenging mountainous terrain.
            <br>
            Machu Picchu remained largely unknown to the outside world until its rediscovery by American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911. Since then, it has become one of the most iconic and visited archaeological sites globally, drawing millions of tourists each year who marvel at its historical significance and awe-inspiring beauty. </p>
